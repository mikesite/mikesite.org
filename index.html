Congratulations!
If you're reading this text, that means you're a human that has decided to manually take a look at my source code.  Wrote it all by hand, thank you very much.
Nothing too complicated as you can see, but I figure it's better than some random website error telling you the site doesn't exist.
If you've read this far, why not send me an email and tell me what you think?  
If you've found this text, I'll bet that you either already have or can figure out my email address as well.
In any case, thanks for taking a look at my site, and I hope you have a great day/night/whatever the time may be for you.

-Mike
